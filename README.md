# Cloning the project for building
Run Git as such:

This will include submodules found in Plugins/ which are necessary for building the project.
The project is configured for Unreal Engine 4.14 (other versions are incompatible due to the provided version of the plugins).

The project may then be built using the Unreal Engine SDK, available from https://www.unrealengine.com/download (registration is necessary in order to use the SDK).
